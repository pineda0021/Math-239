<p>
    <strong>Math 239: Applied Data Science</strong> is based on material developed by
    Dr. Olga Korosteleva from the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at
    California State University, Long Beach. The primary textbook,
    <em>Advanced Regression Models with SAS and R</em>, provides comprehensive
    coverage of advanced regression techniques along with Machine Learning
    methods for predictive modeling. This course will utilize both
    <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>R</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Math 239</strong> is a unique and exciting course designed to explore
    advanced topics like linear regression and machine learning. Unlike other
    offerings in the field, this course provides a hands-on, in-depth experience
    that sets it apart from others across colleges and universities.
</p>

<p>
    Over the next several weeks, you will dive into advanced statistical
    techniques and learn how they apply to real-world data science challenges.
    By the end of our time together, you'll not only understand these concepts
    but also see how they are shaping the future of data analysis.
